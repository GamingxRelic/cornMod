# cornMod
This is the source code for my first Minecraft Mod for 1.17, Relic's Corn Mod. It adds corn and such. Feel free to reference this to make your own mods, have fun! (And if you use it in a modpack, please credit me)
The TESTING branch is just used for my day to edit edits in the code and is used for sharing to get help. The Main branch will be updated as I get the mod to a more complete state.
